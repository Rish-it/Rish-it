# Hi, I'm Rishit Sharma ðŸ‘‹

###  About me:
Hey! I'm Rishit, a final year CS student from India, a software developer who loves to build products that make this world a better place to live.
I usually like to work around **iOS development**, and **Java development**, and while constantly polishing my skills in iOS, I have also started learning **Salesforce** development and I am also trying to get my hands dirty in **Web3** too.

This summer I worked as an IT Intern at **CHEARS**. I have also worked as a Software developer Intern at a bunch of startups, more details can be found in my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mA0DAvLyXnRmGRwNQdzK_X6I-Er-bUvK/view?usp=sharing)

I am constantly learning new things and I enjoy sharing what I have learned with others.

Right now I am looking for new opportunities while making personal projects and diving all into **Java Multiplatform**
